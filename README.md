# Note Taker
## Description:
A note taker that enable users to write and save notes
SO that they can organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks needed to be completed

## How it works
When users open the Note Taker then thEY ARE presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.

When users click on the link to the notes page then they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.

When users enter a new note title and the note’s text then a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page.

When users click on the Save button then the new note users have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear.

When users click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column.

when that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation.

When users click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page then users are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears.
